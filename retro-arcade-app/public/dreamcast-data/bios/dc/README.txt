Dreamcast BIOS files go here.
Place these files (from your own Dreamcast console):

  dc_boot.bin  (2MB - boot ROM)
  dc_flash.bin (128KB - flash memory)

Full paths:
  dc_boot.bin  -> bios/dc/dc_boot.bin
  dc_flash.bin -> bios/dc/dc_flash.bin

These files are not included; you must obtain them yourself.
Do not commit BIOS files to version control.
